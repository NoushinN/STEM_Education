# Resources and Readings

- The first two chapters of The Elements of Statistical Learning cover the material that I will discuss in the first two sessions. Below I discuss a few machine learning texts that may be of interest. All of the texts require knowledge of linear algebra and differential calculus.

- Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman – The Elements of Statistical Learning.[1] Free. (https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf). A great classic text. Starting to show its age a little, especially in neural networks. One of the authors has uses a particularly dense statistical language, but those sections can mostly be skipped if that is not of interest.

- MacKay – Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms.[2] Free for on-screen viewing. (https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) I love this book, but it really is for somebody who is interested in connecting information theory with statistics. The examples are mostly from physics, but as a non-physics person I found them interesting. The examples are great, and the author gives multiple ways to read the book; which chapters to leave out if you are not interested in certain topics. There is no “code” in the book, just a lot of great exercises.

- Bishop – Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.[3] Not free. A good, big book, with a very broad coverage. The statistical level of book jumps around a lot, which means it is easy to miss very important new points.

- Murphy – Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective.[4] Not free. Very dense. I haven’t looked too closely at this one, but the chapters I know are well-written. Be prepared for some undergraduate level math.

- Barber – Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning.[5] Free.  Very dense. Would be helpful for those with a strong understanding of Bayesian methods.
