## Teaching, Learning, and Research

Hello-out-there,

We live in a complex world and we are not prepared for it. In my learning journey, I have been fortunate to benefit from some highly advanced teachers and mentors who taught me to not only learn the lesson materials but learn to know, to do, to live, to be, and to transform myself and the society. To pass this knowledge to the next generation of learners, I myself went on a journey to learn teaching. I participated in a number of teaching and learning classes in the last year and have been inspired by several core ideas and philosophies about teaching, learning, and STEM education that I would like to implement in my teaching practices going forward.

It is my passion to enhance excellence in education by implementing modern and effective teaching practices for diverse learners. For example, I myself am a visual learner and do recognize when my mind wanders when the lesson materials miss visuals. Recognizing that learning styles are quite diverse for participants, the hones is on instructors to develop materials that cater to every learning type be it visual, auditory, abstract/mathematical, spatial, or lingual learners. My goal as an instructor is to be a constructive agent for a learning journey towards success. 

I think improvement of teaching and learning is a dynamic and ongoing process, just as is research in any STEM discipline.  Therefore, I strive for creating a continual revival, improvement, engagement, learning community, and learning through diversity and inclusion. 

At the core of improving teaching and learning is the need to accurately determine what we have learned. This is a research problem, to which STEM educators can effectively apply their research skills and ways of knowing. 

In applying a research approach to teaching, I strive to apply **7 processes**: 
  
**(i)** learning foundational knowledge,   
**(ii)** creating objectives for learning,  
**(iii)** developing an hypothesis for practices to achieve the learning objectives,  
**(iv)** defining measures of success,  
**(v)** developing and implementing teaching practices within an experimental design,  
**(vi)** collecting and analyzing data from lessons,  
**(vii)** reflecting, evaluating, and iterating lessons.  

Some of the lessons I am currently curating and organizing for data science can be found [here](https://github.com/NoushinN/STEM_Education/tree/master/Data%20Analysis%20Lessons).   
Some of the literature that have inspired this philosophy can be found [here](https://github.com/NoushinN/STEM_Teaching_Learning_Research/tree/master/Teaching%20Literature).
