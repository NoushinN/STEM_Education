## STEM Teaching, Learning, and Research

Hello-out-there,

We live in a complex world and we are not prepared for it. In my learning journey, I have been fortunate to benefit from some highly advanced teachers and mentors who taught me to not only learn the lesson materials but learn to know, to do, to live, to be, and to transform myself and the society. To pass this knowledge to the next generation of students, I myself went on a journey to learn teaching. I participated in a number of teaching and learning classes in the last year and have been inspired by several core ideas and philosophies about teaching, learning, and STEM education that I would like to implement in my teaching practices going forward.

My central teaching philosophy stems from the desire to enhance excellence in undergraduate education through by implementing and advancing effective teaching practices for diverse learners. I like to be a constructive agent for student success and be part of a learning experience that leads them to success. The ultimate mission of this philosophy is to enhance excellence in undergraduate STEM education through the development and implementation of effective lessons for diverse learners and be part of their successful launch and transition to professional careers.

I believe that the improvement of teaching and learning is a dynamic and ongoing process, just as is research in any STEM discipline.  Therefore, in my teaching design, I strive for creating a continual revival, improvement, engagement, learning community, and learning through diversity and inclusion. 

At the core of improving teaching and learning is the need to accurately determine what students have learned as a result of teaching practices. This is a research problem, to which STEM educators can effectively apply their research skills and ways of knowing. In so doing, I strive to myself become the agents for change in STEM teaching and learning. To implement this, I try to incorporate a deliberate, systematic, and reflective use of research methods to develop and implement teaching practices that advance the learning experiences and outcomes of students and teachers.

In applying a research approach to my teaching practices, I strive to apply **7 processes** in practice:   
**(i)** learning foundational knowledge,   
**(ii)** creating objectives for student learning,  
**(iii)** developing an hypothesis for practices to achieve the learning objectives,  
**(iv)** defining measures of success,  
**(v)** developing and implementing teaching practices within an experimental design,  
**(vi)** collecting and analyzing data,  
**(vii)** reflecting, evaluating, and iterating.  

Some of the lessons I have curated and developed for statistical data analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/NoushinN/STEM_Education/tree/master/Data%20Analysis%20Lessons).   
Some of the literature that have inspired this philosophy can be found [here](https://github.com/NoushinN/STEM_Teaching_Learning_Research/tree/master/Teaching%20Literature).
