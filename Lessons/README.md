**Overview**    
These lessons in this repo are developed for R statistical analyses for the most part.
Lessons revolve around concepts on _data cleaning_, _data wrangling_, as well as _statistical approaches_ for thinking about data. 
Some of the concepts include **probability** and **sampling distributions**, **exploratory data analysis**, **statistical experiments**, as well as **regression** and **classification**.
